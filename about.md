Hi! My name is Frederick Jansen and I'm a game developer at Goodgame Studios, working in the core team. Before that I studied Interactive Multimedia Design at Thomas More Mechelen, and am currently working towards my master's degree in Information Technology with a focus in Information Management Systems at Harvard Extension School. I am lucky enough to be able to travel back and forth between Hamburg and Boston for this.

Most of what I write here will be technical in nature. I thoroughly enjoy playing around with code on the level of bits and bytes. After writing a player for FLAC and APNG in AS3, my interest has shifted to CPU emulation. You can find some of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/frederickjansen) and reach out to me through [LinkedIn](http://be.linkedin.com/in/jansenfrederick) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/latenightsnacks) (which I never use to write anything myself).
